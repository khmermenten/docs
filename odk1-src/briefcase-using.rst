Using ODK Briefcase
======================

.. _pull-from-aggregate:

Pulling forms from Aggregate
----------------------------

To download blank forms and completed form instances from an :doc:`Aggregate <aggregate-intro>` server:

#. Open the :guilabel:`Pull` tab.
#. Select *Aggregate server* in the :guilabel:`Pull from` drop-down.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Configure` button.
#. Enter the URL and login credentials for your Aggregate server in the dialog that pops up and click the :guilabel:`Connect` button.

   If you have anonymous login enabled on Aggregate, no login credentials are needed here.

   To connect to the `Aggregate Demo Server`_, the URL is https://opendatakit.appspot.com.

   .. _Aggregate Demo Server: https://opendatakit.appspot.com

#. Briefcase will show a list of forms for download. Only forms that are marked in Aggregate as downloadable will be shown.

#. Select the forms you want to download and click :guilabel:`Pull`. The selected forms will be pulled to your :ref:`Briefcase Storage <briefcase_storage>` location.

   For each selected form, Briefcase will pull down:

   - The form definition file (that is, the blank XForm).
   - All media associated with the form.
   - Completed form instances, including all their attached media files.

   If you have previously pulled the form:

   - The form definition file and media files will not be pulled.
   - New instances will be downloaded.

   .. warning::

     If your local copy and the remote copy of the blank form definition file are different, the pull will be aborted.

     .. rubric:: Workaround

     If the form definition has changed, but the changes only affect the question text and do not alter the structure of the collected data (or change the form ID or version), you can:

     #. In :guilabel:`Settings`, temporarily change the :ref:`Briefcase Storage <briefcase_storage>` location.
     #. Pull data into to the new location.
     #. Manually copy the instances from the temporary location of your original storage location.
     #. Update :guilabel:`Settings` back to the original :ref:`Briefcase Storage <briefcase_storage>` location.

  :name: briefcase-parallel-connections

  .. rubric:: Pull forms faster with parallel connections

  .. container:: details

    To speed up pulling forms from Aggregate, enable :guilabel:`Pull submissions in parallel` in the :guilabel:`Settings` tab.

    .. image:: /img/briefcase-using/pull-in-parallel.*

    However, if your Aggregate server is :doc:`installed on Google App Engine <aggregate-app-engine>`, this setting may cause problems with large attachments. If your form has submission attachments (file uploads, videos, images, sound recordings) you should experiment with this setting and see if it improves or worsens performance.

.. note::
  :name: briefcase-start-pull-from-last-submission-pulled

  .. rubric:: Start pull from last submission pulled

  .. container:: details

    If your forms have more than 100 submissions, enable the configuration parameter :guilabel:`Start pull from last submission pulled` in the :guilabel:`Settings` tab to improve pull performance on slow connections.

    .. image:: /img/briefcase-using/start-pull-from-last-submission-pulled.*

    You can clear the pull history and pull every submission by clicking on the :guilabel:`Clear pull history` button at the bottom of the :guilabel:`Settings` tab.

.. _pull-from-collect:

Pulling forms from Collect
------------------------------

#. Ensure all filled-in forms are finalized.

   If you have incomplete forms that you cannot finalize before pulling into Briefcase, delete them. If you need to keep them, make a copy of :file:`/sdcard/odk` before deleting them, and restore it after you are finished.

#. Create a zip archive of the entire :file:`odk` directory.

   .. tip::

     You'll need to use an app for this.

     One option is `OI File Manager <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openintents.filemanager>`_.

#. Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable and choose to mount it as a Media device.
#. Copy the zip file you created from the Android device to your local hard drive.
#. Once it is copied onto your local hard drive, unzip the file.
#. In Briefcase, open the :guilabel:`Pull` tab.
#. Select *Collect directory* in the :guilabel:`Pull from` drop-down.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Configure` button and select the unzipped :file:`odk` folder.
#. Select the forms you want to download and click :guilabel:`Pull`. The selected forms will be pulled to your :ref:`Briefcase Storage <briefcase_storage>` location.
#. On the Android device, open Collect and delete the filled-in forms.

   .. tip::

     - You can use the *Collect directory* any time you want to pull forms from custom location.
     - You can confirm that the forms have been successfully pulled into Briefcase by confirming a successful pull status or by verifying the data appearing in a :ref:`CSV export file <briefcase-export-to-csv>`.

.. warning::

  Briefcase cannot discriminate between duplicate form instances. After you pull completed forms into Briefcase, it is important that you delete them from Collect. Otherwise, the next time you pull in forms, you will create duplicates.

.. note::

  Briefcase does not support pushing blank forms to Collect. Instead, :ref:`manually load the forms on your Collect device <loading-forms-directly>`.

.. _pull-form-definition:

Pulling form definitions
------------------------

#. Open the :guilabel:`Pull` tab.
#. Select *Form definition* in the :guilabel:`Pull from` drop-down.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Configure` button and select the :file:`.xml` form definition file.
#. Select the form and click :guilabel:`Pull`. The form will be pulled to your :ref:`Briefcase Storage <briefcase_storage>` location.

.. tip::

  This enables a workflow to upload forms with media attachments to Aggregate:

  #. Pull the form using the :guilabel:`Pull from` option.
  #. :ref:`Push the form to your Aggregate server <push-to-aggregate>`.

.. warning::

  Ensure that all attached media is available relative to the form definition file location.

.. _push-to-aggregate:

Pushing forms to Aggregate
--------------------------

To upload blank forms and completed form instances to an :doc:`Aggregate <aggregate-intro>` server:

#. Open the :guilabel:`Push` tab.
#. Select *Aggregate server* in the :guilabel:`Push to` drop-down.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Configure` button.
#. Enter the URL and login credentials for your Aggregate server in the dialog that pops up and click the :guilabel:`Connect` button.

   If you have anonymous login enabled on Aggregate, no login credentials are needed here.

   To connect to the `Aggregate Demo Server`_, the URL is https://opendatakit.appspot.com.

   .. _Aggregate Demo Server: https://opendatakit.appspot.com

#. Select the forms you want to upload and click :guilabel:`Push`. The selected forms will be pushed from your :ref:`Briefcase Storage <briefcase_storage>` to the Aggregate server.

   For each selected form, Briefcase will upload:

     - The form definition file (that is, the blank XForm).
     - All media associated with the form.
     - Completed form instances, including all their attached media files.

   .. warning::

     If your local copy and the remote copy of the blank form definition file are different, the push will be aborted.

     .. rubric:: Workaround

     If the form definition has changed, but the changes only affect the question text and do not alter the structure of the collected data (or change the form ID or version), you can:

     #. In :guilabel:`Settings`, temporarily change the :ref:`Briefcase Storage <briefcase_storage>` location.
     #. Manually copy the form directory from your original storage location of the temporary location.
     #. Replace the local form definition file with a copy of the version from your Aggregate server.
     #. Push your form instances.
     #. Update :guilabel:`Settings` back to the original :ref:`Briefcase Storage <briefcase_storage>` location.

.. _briefcase-export-to-csv:

Export forms to CSV
-------------------

#. Open the :guilabel:`Export` tab.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`Set Default Configuration` button.

  - Set an :guilabel:`Export directory`.
  - If exporting :doc:`encrypted-forms`, set the corresponding :guilabel:`PEM file location`. See :ref:`the Encrypted forms section <create-key>` for more information.
  - If you wish, select a :guilabel:`Start date` and an :guilabel:`End date` to specify a limited date range to export.
  - Toggle export parameters as needed:

    - :guilabel:`Export media files` enables exporting media files into the chosen export directory
    - :guilabel:`Overwrite existing files` enables overwriting form instance data in the output files. The default behavior is to append data.
    - :guilabel:`Split select multiples` enables splitting select multiple fields. Enabling this setting will create an extra output column per select choice, with a `1` if the choice was selected, or `0` otherwise. This only affects select fields without a choice filter and that are not from an external file (including widgets with search appearance).
    - :guilabel:`Include GeoJSON` enables generating a GeoJSON file with spatial data from all exported submissions.
    - :guilabel:`Remove group names` enables removing non-repeat group names from column names in the CSV.
    - :guilabel:`Pull before export` enables trying to pull the selected forms in case there are new form instances to be exported.

#. Select the forms to export.

   If you are selecting and exporting more than one form, you may need to set individual export settings. To do this, click the gear icon (:guilabel:`âš™`) next to the form name.

#. Click :guilabel:`Export`.

Output files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Briefcase will generate a different number of files and directories depending on the form's contents and the export configuration selected by the user. This can include, per form:

  - One main CSV file. For example: `Form Name.csv`
  - If the form includes any repeat group, one CSV file for each one of them. For example: `Form Name-repeat group name.csv`
  - If any submission includes binary attachments, they are copied to a `media` directory, relative to the export directory. For example: `media/1538040007350.jpg`
  - If the user enables the :guilabel:`Include GeoJSON export` configuration option, one GeoJSON file with spatial data. For example: `Form Name.geojson`
  - If the form includes audit metadata:

    - One CSV file with audit data from all submissions. For example: `Form Name - audit.csv`
    - One CSV audit file for each exported submission in the `media` directory, relative to the export directory. For example: `media/audit-uuid56880d5e-ee8a-4832-b69d-6dfdd526e2dc.csv`

.. csv-table:: Summary Table
  :header: Output file, How many?, Conditions, Path, Example

  Main CSV, One, , `./`, `Form Name.csv`
  Repeat CSV, One per repeat group, , `./`, `Form Name-repeat group name.csv`
  Binary attachment, As many as there are in submissions, , `./media`, `media/1538040007350.jpg`
  GeoJSON, One, The user enables `Include GeoJSON export`, `./`, `Form Name.geojson`
  Audit CSV, One, The form includes audit metadata, `./`, `Form Name - audit.csv`
  Individual audit CSV, One per submission, The form includes audit metadata, `./media`, `audit-uuid56880d5e-ee8a-4832-b69d-6dfdd526e2dc.csv`

There's more information available about the CSV file content structure and filename patterns in `the export format documentation`_.

.. _briefcase-log-files:

Briefcase log files
-------------------

Briefcase creates a log file with warnings and errors that might be useful for troubleshooting.

.. _briefcase-default-log-file-location:

Default log file location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If something goes wrong while using Briefcase and you look for help, it's possible that you're asked to provide your log file.

The default location for the log file is the directory where you are when launching Briefcase, and the default filename is "briefcase.log"

Briefcase will create the log file on launch if it doesn't previously exist. Otherwise, it will append lines at the end of a pre-existing log file.

.. _briefcase-custom-log-configuration:

How to use a custom log configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Optionally, you can use a custom log configuration file to override the default log settings on Briefcase.

First, you need to create a "logback.xml" file somewhere in your computer to contain your custom log configuration. This is a sample configuration file you can use as a template:

.. code-block:: xml

  <configuration>
    <appender name="ROLLINGFILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
      <file>briefcase.log</file>
      <rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy">
        <fileNamePattern>briefcase.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.log</fileNamePattern>
        <maxHistory>30</maxHistory>
        <totalSizeCap>100MB</totalSizeCap>
      </rollingPolicy>
      <encoder>
        <pattern>%d [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
      </encoder>
    </appender>

    <root level="info">
      <appender-ref ref="ROLLINGFILE" />
    </root>
  </configuration>


Check the full syntax of Logback configuration files `here`_.

  .. _here: https://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html#syntax

You can set all sorts of new log configurations to adapt Briefcase to your needs:

 - Set a fixed log file location
 - Fine tune the log's verbosity by setting a different log level
 - Silence specific log lines while keeping others
 - Set a custom log format (see the `Encoders`_ chapter)
 - Set custom appenders, to define a file rolling policy (daily, by log file size, for example), for example (see the `Appenders`_ chapter)

  .. _Encoders: https://logback.qos.ch/manual/encoders.html
  .. _Appenders: https://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html

Once you have your configuration file ready, you can use it by adding a `-Dlogging.config` argument when launching Briefcase:

.. code-block:: console

  $ java -Dlogging.config="{path/to/logback.xml}" -jar {path/to/briefcase-jar-file}
