Administering Aggregate
===========================

Click the :guilabel:`Log In` link in the upper right corner of the screen to be presented with the Log onto Aggregate screen. Choose the :guilabel:`Sign in with Aggregate password` button and enter the super-user username you specified within the installer. The initial password for this account is `aggregate`. When you log in, :guilabel:`Site Admin` will be visible to you.

.. tip::

  When signing in with this method, if you do not enter the password correctly, you may need to close all your browser windows and quit your browser before you can try again.

.. warning::

  If the instance name of the server changes (the installer asks for this name), then the passwords for all ODK Aggregate usernames will no longer be valid and the super-user username's password will be reset to *aggregate*. In this case, you should log in, change the super-user's password, and change the passwords for all of your ODK Aggregate usernames.
