Installing Central on Digital Ocean
===================================

If you'd like to set up an ODK server that's accessible from anywhere via the Internet, DigitalOcean provides a one-click configuration that's nicely geared with nearly all the tools you'll need to set up your new server. The only thing it doesn't do is register a domain name, which you will have to do in order to obtain a security certificate for your server.

.. tip::
  If you have not already created a DigitalOcean account, use `our referral link <https://m.do.co/c/39937689124c>`_.

  DigitalOcean will give you $100 of credit to spend during the first 60 days so that you can try things out. Once you have spent $25 with them, weâ€™ll get $25 to put towards our hosting costs.

In general, this installation process will involve five phases:

1. Obtaining a server and loading it with the appropriate base system.
2. Obtaining a web address (domain name) and pointing it at your new server.
3. Obtaining the ODK Central software and installing it on your server.
4. Preparing ODK Central for startup and running it for the first time.
5. Creating your first Central Administrator account and logging into it.

There are also some optional other steps you can take, which you can find at the bottom of this page.

.. _central-install-digital-ocean-server:

Obtaining a Server
------------------

In this phase, you will create a new server on DigitalOcean, choose a pricing tier, configure it with the correct base operating system, and start it up.

If you haven't already, create an account on `DigitalOcean <https://m.do.co/c/39937689124c>`_. Then, from the DigitalOcean control panel, use the **Create** button at the top to create a new Droplet. This is their name for a server you can access and manage.

   .. image:: /img/central-install/create-droplet.png

At the very top, under **Choose an image**, switch to the **One-click apps** tab and select the **Docker** option. The version does not matter.

   .. image:: /img/central-install/docker-app.png

As you continue down this page, there are a few options that may be important to you:

 - There is a section for standard droplets and another for more expensive optimized droplets. In general, you should not need optimized droplets.
 - The **size** option affects a few things, but the most important is the amount of memory available to your server. Memory does not affect storage space, it sets the amount of "thinking room" the server gets while it's working on things. If you don't expect many forms to be submitted at once and you don't expect many large media attachments, you can start with 1GB. Higher-load servers and servers which handle many image or video attachments may need 2GB or more. It is pretty easy to upgrade to a larger size later.
 - The datacenter region selects where physically your server will be located. If you have security concerns, this is your chance to decide which country hosts your data. Otherwise, generally selecting the option with closest geographic proximity to your users is a good idea.
 - If you plan on setting up DKIM (see below), you will want to set the name of the server to the full domain name you intend to host your server.
 - If you are technically savvy and understand what an SSH key is, there is a field here that you will want to fill in. If not, don't worry about it.

Once you click on **Create**, you'll be taken back to the Droplet management page. It may think for a moment, and then your new server should appear. Next to it will be an IP address, which should look something like ``183.47.101.24``. This is where your server is publicly located on the Internet. Don't worry, nobody can do anything with it until you let them.

Congratulations! With those steps, you have now created a new server which you can access over the Internet, and started it up. Next, we will get a web domain name address (like ``opendatakit.org``) to point at it.

.. _central-install-digital-ocean-domain:

Obtaining a Web Address (Domain Name)
-------------------------------------

Now is the time to set up a domain name. We will do so, and then configure it so that it sends users to the server you created in the previous step.

You'll need to do this for two reasons: a memorable name (like ``google.com``) will be easier to remember and access than a pile of numbers, and you cannot obtain a security certificate without one. It is not currently possible to host ODK Central within a subdirectory on another domain (so, ``my-website.com/my-odk-server`` is not possible, but ``my-odk-server.com`` is allowed, as is ``my-odk-server.my-website.com``).

If you already know how to do these sorts of things, feel free to ignore the following instructions and proceed on your own. You can rejoin us at the next section.

For the rest of us, there are some options here:

 - You can pay one of the many popular commercial domain registrars for a full domain name, like ``MyOdkCollectionServer.com``. Search for "domain registrar" to find one of these. These often cost as little as $3/year.
 - You can use a free DNS service: we recommend `FreeDNS <https://freedns.afraid.org/>`_, which has run for a long time and has a good reputation. With it, you can obtain a free name, albeit with a fixed second half (like ``MyOdkCollectionServer.dynet.com``). If you choose this route, we recommend using one of the *less popular* names, as the heavily occupied names can run into trouble later on (in particular, obtaining a security certificate from Let's Encrypt).

Whichever option you choose, once you obtain a domain name you'll want to look at `DigitalOcean's guide <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean>`_ on setting up domain names for your Droplet. In general, you'll point your domain name in DigitalOcean's direction at your registrar, then in DigitalOcean itself you'll want to create an A record that points to the IP address we found above.

New domain names take a little bit to get working. Meanwhile, we can get working on installing the server software.

.. _central-install-digital-ocean-build:

Installing ODK Central
----------------------

In this phase of installation, we will log into your new server, obtain the ODK Central software, load some settings into it, and install it.

First, you'll need to be able to log into the server itself. If you are an advanced user who filled in an SSH key above, you're good to go. Otherwise, click your email for a message from DigitalOcean with your server password.

Once you have that password in hand, you'll be able to use the **Launch Console** button to log into your server: when it asks for ``login``, type ``root`` and press **Enter**. Then type the password you were emailed and press **Enter** again.

   .. image:: /img/central-install/access-page.png

Once you are in your server, you'll want to change your password so that people snooping your email do not gain access. You should be automatically asked for a new password the first time you log in. If you are not, type ``passwd`` and press **Enter**, then follow the instructions to choose a new password. From now on, you will use that password to log in.

Now you'll need to download the software. In the server window, type ``git clone https://github.com/opendatakit/central`` and press **Enter**. It should think for some time and download many things. Then type `cd central` to start working with the software.

   .. image:: /img/central-install/cloned.png

You now have the framework of the server software, but some components are missing. Type ``git submodule update -i`` and press **Enter** to download them.

Next, you need to update some settings. Type ``nano .env`` and press **Enter**. This will launch a text editing application.

 - Change the ``SSLTYPE`` line to read: ``SSLTYPE=letsencrypt``. This instructs the server to attempt to obtain a security certificate from the free Let's Encrypt provider.
 - Change the ``SSLDOMAIN`` line so that after the ``=`` is the domain name you registered above. As an example: ``SSLDOMAIN=MyOdkCollectionServer.com``. Do not include anything like ``http://``.
 - Change the ``SSLEMAIL`` line so that after the ``=`` is your own email address. The Let's Encrypt service will use this address only to notify you if something is wrong with your security certificate.
 - Hold ``Ctrl`` and press ``x`` to quit the text editor. Press ``y`` to indicate that you want to save the file, and then press **Enter** to confirm the file name. Do not change the file name.

   .. image:: /img/central-install/nano.png

Now, we will bundle everything together into a server. Type ``docker-compose build`` and press **Enter** to do this. This will take a long time and generate quite a lot of text output. Don't worry if it seems to pause without saying anything for a while. When it finishes, you should see some "Successfully built" type text and get your input prompt back. When that happens, type ``docker-compose create`` and press **Enter**.

Once that is complete, congratulations! You have installed your copy of ODK Central. Next, we need to teach the server how to start it up, and do so.

.. _central-install-digital-ocean-startup:

Starting up ODK Central
-----------------------

Now, we want to run your new ODK server software. But we don't want to only run it once: if we do that, then if your machine crashes or restarts, the software won't start back up. We want to tell the machine to always run the server. To teach it to do this, we have to copy a file to the right spot. To do this, run ``cp files/docker-compose@.service /etc/systemd/system``.

Once that's done, run ``systemctl start docker-compose@central`` (type it in and press **Enter**) to start Docker, which will then load the ODK server. The first time you start it, it will take a while to set itself up. Once you give it a few minutes and you have input control again, you'll want to see whether everything is running correctly:

 - To see if Docker itself is working correctly, you can run ``systemctl status docker-compose@central``. If you see text that says ``Active: active (running)`` then everything is working great.
 - To see if ODK has finished loading inside of Docker, run ``docker-compose ps``. Under the ``State`` column, you will want to see text that reads ``Up (healthy)``. If you see ``Up (health: starting)``, give it a few minutes. If you see some other text, something has gone wrong.
 - If your domain name has started working, you can visit it in a web browser to check that you get the ODK Central management website.

Once we're finally sure that everything is working, run ``systemctl enable docker-compose@central``. This will make sure the ODK server is always running, even if something goes wrong or the machine reboots.

You're almost done! All you have to do is create an Administrator account so that you can log into Central.

.. _central-install-digital-ocean-account:

Logging into ODK Central
------------------------

If visiting your server domain name address in your browser does not load the ODK Central management website, you may have to wait a few minutes or hours (possibly even a day) for the domain name itself to get working. These instructions are explained in further depth on the page detailing the :doc:`central-command-line`.

Once you do see it working, you'll want to set up your first Administrator account. To do this:

 - Ensure that you are in the ``central`` folder on your server. If you have not closed your console session from earlier, you should be fine. If you have just logged back into it, you'll want to run ``cd central`` to navigate to that folder.
 - Then, type ``docker-compose exec service odk-cmd --email YOUREMAIL@ADDRESSHERE.com user-create``, substituting your email address as appropriate. Press **Enter**, and you will be asked for a password for this new account.
 - The previous step created an account but did not make it an administrator. To do this, type ``docker-compose exec service odk-cmd --email YOUREMAIL@ADDRESSHERE.com user-promote`` **Enter**.
 - You are done for now, but if you ever lose track of your password, you can always reset it by typing ``docker-compose exec service odk-cmd --email YOUREMAIL@ADDRESSHERE.com user-set-password``. As with account creation, you will be prompted for a new password after you press **Enter**.

Once you have one account, you do not have to go through this process again for future accounts: you can log into the website with your new account, and directly create new users that way.

You're done! Congratulations. In the future, you may wish to consult the :doc:`central-upgrade` guide, but for now you may begin using ODK Central. The :doc:`central-using` sections can help you with your next steps if you aren't sure how to proceed.

.. _central-install-digital-ocean-advanced:

Advanced Configuration Options
==============================

The following sections each detail a particular customization you can make to your server setup. Most installations should not need to perform these tasks, and some of them assume some advanced working knowledge on administering Linux web servers. If you aren't sure what something means, the best option is probably to skip the section completely.

.. _central-install-digital-ocean-dkim:

Configuring DKIM
----------------

DKIM is a security trust protocol which is used to help verify mail server identities. Without it, your sent mail is likely to be flagged as spam. If you intend to use a custom mail server (see the following section), these instructions will not be relevant to you. Otherwise:

1. Ensure that your server's name in DigitalOcean `matches your full domain name <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-do-i-setup-a-ptr-record?comment=30810>`_, and that the `hostname does as well <https://askubuntu.com/questions/938786/how-to-permanently-change-host-name/938791#938791>`_. If you had to make changes for this step, restart the server to ensure they take effect.
2. Now, you'll need to generate a cryptographic keypair and enable the DKIM configuration. Run these commands:

   .. code-block:: console

     cd ~/central/files/dkim
     openssl genrsa -out rsa.private 1024 
     openssl rsa -in rsa.private -out rsa.public -pubout -outform PEM
     cp config.disabled config

3. With the contents of the public key (``cat rsa.public``), you'll want to create two new TXT DNS records:

   1. At the location ``dkim._domainkey.YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME-HERE``, create a new ``TXT`` record with the contents ``k=rsa; p=PUBLIC-KEY-HERE``. You only want the messy text *between* the dashed boundaries, and you'll want to be sure to remove any line breaks in the public key text, so that it's all only letters, numbers, ``+``, and ``/``.
   2. At your domain name location, create a new ``TXT`` record with the contents ``v=spf1 a mx ip4:SERVER-IP-ADDRESS-HERE -all`` where you can obtain the server IP address from the DigitalOcean control panel.

4. Finally, build and run to configure EXIM to use the cryptographic keys you generated:

   .. code-block:: console

     cd ~/central
     docker-compose build mail
     systemctl restart docker-compose@central

   If that doesn't work, you may need to first remove your old mail container (``docker-compose rm mail``).

.. _central-install-digital-ocean-custom-mail:

Using a Custom Mail Server
--------------------------

ODK Central ships with a basic EXIM server bundled to forward mail out to the internet. To use your own custom mail server:

1. Ensure you have an SMTP relay server visible to your Central server network host.
2. Edit the file ``files/service/config.json.template``:
   * Under ``email``, then ``transportOpts``, you'll find settings for ``host`` and ``port``.
   * These correspond with the network hostname and the TCP port, respectively.
3. Build and run: ``docker-compose build service`` and ``systemctl restart docker-compose@central``. If that doesn't work, you may need to first remove your old service container (``docker-compose rm service``).

.. _central-install-digital-ocean-sentry:

Disabling Sentry
----------------

By default, we enable `Sentry error logging <https://sentry.io>`_ on the backend server, which provides the ODK Central development team with an anonymized log of unexpected programming errors that occur while your server is running. This information is only visible to the development team and should never any of your user or form data, but if you feel uncomfortable with this anyway, you can take the following steps to disable Sentry:

1. Edit the file ``files/service/config.json.template`` and remove the ``sentry`` lines, starting with ``"sentry": {`` through the next three lines until you remove the matching ``}``.
2. Build and run: ``docker-compose build service`` and ``systemctl restart docker-compose@central``.

.. _central-install-digital-ocean-custom-ssl:

Using a Custom SSL Certificate
------------------------------

By default, ODK Central uses Let's Encrypt to obtain an SSL security certificate. For most users, this should work perfectly, but larger managed internal networks may have their own certificate trust infrastructure. To use your own custom SSL certificate rather than the automatic Let's Encrypt system:

1. Generate appropriate ``fullchain.pem`` (``-out``) and ``privkey.pem`` (``-keyout``) files.
2. Copy those files into ``files/local/customssl/`` within the repository root.
3. In ``.env``, set ``SSL_TYPE`` to ``customssl`` and set ``DOMAIN`` to ``local``.
4. Build and run: ``docker-compose build nginx`` and ``systemctl restart docker-compose@central``. If that doesn't work, you may need to first remove your old nginx container (``docker-compose rm nginx``).
