Question Types
=================

:doc:`collect-intro` supports forms with a wide variety of question types.
The exact functionality and display style of each question
are specified in your `XLSForm`_ definition using the 
:th:`type` and :th:`appearance` columns.

.. _XLSForm: http://xlsform.org

.. contents:: :depth: 1

.. admonition:: Helpful terminology

  .. glossary::

    question

      A prompt to the user, usually requesting a response.
      Questions are written as a single line in an XLSForm,
      and usually appear on a single screen in Collect.

    widget

      A rendered question screen in Collect.
      The :th:`type` and :th:`appearance` of a question
      determine the widget that is displayed.

.. note::

  This document covers the full range of question types and options
  available when creating forms using `XLSForm`_.
  
  For simpler forms
  you can use :doc:`build-intro`,
  which provides a visual, drag-and-drop interface.

  
.. _text-widget:

Text widgets
--------------

All of the text widgets share the :tc:`text` type,
and the inputs from them are saved as literal strings.

.. warning::

  If you are using Aggregate and expect answers to be more than 255 characters, you should :doc:`increase the database field length to over 255 characters <aggregate-field-length>`.

type
  :tc:`text`
appearance
  :tc:`numbers`


A numerical input that treats the input as a string, rather than a number.

The number input accepts numerals (``0123456789``), hyphens (``-``), and decimal points (``.``). These are the only characters available on the number keypad displayed with this widget.

This is useful for phone numbers, ID numbers, IP addresses, and similar data. It can also be used in place of the :ref:`default-integer-widget` or :ref:`default-decimal-widget` if large numbers are needed. (The integer widget has a limit of nine digits, and the decimal widget has a limit of 15 characters.)

.. _time-widget:

Time widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  :tc:`time`
appearance
  *none*

A time selector. Captures only a specific time-of-day, not a date and time. For date and time, see the :ref:`datetime-widget`.

The time widget does not accept any :th:`appearance` attributes.

.. note::
  :name: time-zone-note


  The time widget stores the time along with a time zone.
  This can cause unexpected behavior around `Daylight saving time`_.
  
  .. _Daylight saving time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time
  
  For example, if you record a time before the clock change,
  and then view the time after the clock change,
  it will appear to be an hour off.
  This happens because the recorded time data
  is understood as a specific moment in time
  that is being "translated" into your current, local time zone.
  
  A similar problem occurs when moving between geographic time zones.
  
  This makes the time widget unsuitable for abstract 
  time-of-day questions such as *What time do you usually wake up?*
  For questions like this, you may want to use a :ref:`select-minimal`.
  You can set the options at whatever level of accuracy you need --- 
  for example, 15 or 30 minute increments.
  Alternatively, you could use the select widget for hours,
  and an :ref:`default-integer-widget` for minutes.

.. _select-widgets:
  
Select widgets
-----------------

Select widgets offer the :term:`participant` options to pick from.
You can offer the participant 
a :ref:`single choice <single-select-widget>`,
or the ability to :ref:`choose multiple answers <multi-select-widget>`. The order of the choices can be :ref:`randomized <randomize-choice-order>` for any of the select types described below.

The options for a select question are listed
on a sheet named **choices**, in your XLSForm file.
The **choices** sheet has at least three columns:

:th:`list_name`
  A set of choices for a single question share a common :th:`list_name`.
  The value of :th:`list_name` is included in the :th:`type` column
  on the **survey** sheet.

:th:`name`
  The canonical identifier for a specific choice. This value is what is stored on the completed form. If you :ref:`refer to a select response using a variable <variables>`, the :th:`name` string is returned.
  
  As with the **survey** sheet, :th:`name` must not include spaces.

:th:`label`
  The user-facing text displayed for the choice.

Select widgets can :ref:`include images as choices <select-image-widget>`.

.. _image-options:

Including image, video, or audio files as choices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To include image, video, or audio files as choices for select questions:

1. Specify the file names in the **choices** worksheet, in a column labeled as :th:`media::image` for image files, :th:`media::video` for video files, and :th:`media::audio` for audio files respectively.

  .. csv-table:: choices
    :header: list_name, name, label, media::image, media::video, media::audio

    opt_media,a,A,a.jpg
    opt_media,b,B,,b.mp4
    opt_media,c,C,,,c.mp3

2. Add the files to a folder named
   :file:`{form-name}-media`.
3. Upload the media folder with your form.

   - If you are hosting your form in :doc:`aggregate-intro`,
     you will have the option to upload the media file with your form,
     and it will be automatically downloaded to your device
     when you pull down the blank form.
   - If you are adding the form to your device directly,
     make sure the media folder is placed in
     :file:`/sdcard/odk/forms/`.

.. _randomize-choice-order:

Randomizing choice order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

  Randomizing choice order support was added in Collect v1.18.2 and Aggregate v1.7.1. Form conversion requires XLSForm Online ‚â• v1.2.2, XLSForm Offline ‚â• v1.7.1, or pyxform ‚â• v0.11.6.

To reduce bias, choice order can be randomized for any of the select question types described above. To display the choices in a different order each time the question is displayed, set **randomize** to **true** in the :th:`parameters` column of the XLSForm **survey** sheet:

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, parameters, name, label

  select_one opt_abcd,randomize=true,select_one_random_widget,"Select one with random choice order set on each display"

.. csv-table:: choices
  :header: list_name, name, label

  opt_abcd,a,A
  opt_abcd,b,B
  opt_abcd,c,C
  opt_abcd,d,D

In the example above, each time the question is displayed, the choices will be in a different order. It is often preferable to pick one order that the choices will always be displayed in for a given filled form. This can be accomplished by setting an integer seed for the randomization.

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, parameters, name, label, calculation

  calculate,,my_seed,,"once(substr(decimal-date-time(now()), 10))"
  select_one opt_abcd,"randomize=true,seed=${my_seed}",select_one_widget,Select one with random choice order set once per filled form

.. csv-table:: choices
  :header: list_name, name, label

  opt_abcd,a,A
  opt_abcd,b,B
  opt_abcd,c,C
  opt_abcd,d,D

This seed can also be used to recreate the order choices were displayed in. See `the XForms spec <https://opendatakit.github.io/xforms-spec/#fn:randomize>`_ for a description of the randomization algorithm used.

.. note::

  In the example above, the integer seed is created from the last 8 numbers of the :func:`decimal-date-time()` which is unlikely to repeat across devices. In the seed expression, :func:`once` is important because it makes sure the seed is not changed if the same filled form is opened more than once.

.. _or-other:  

Including "other" as a choice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the **survey** sheet, in the :th:`type` column,
after the type and the list_name,
you can add :tc:`or_other`.
This will add "Other" as an additional option to your choice list.
The :th:`name` value of the choice when selected will be :tc:`other`.


.. _rank-widget:

Rank widget
-----------------

The rank widget allows the user to order options from a list. The value saved in the form and sent to the server is a space-separated ordered list of the options.

Like with :ref:`select-widgets`, the options are listed on a sheet named **choices** in an XLSForm.

To change the order of the options in the list, tap the :guilabel:`Rank items` button. In the resulting dialog, long press on an item and once it gets a border around it, drag it up or down to change the order. If no :ref:`default <default-responses>` is provided, the value for the question is blank until the user taps :guilabel:`OK` in the ranking dialog.

  the device must find at least four (4) satellites.
  If the device can not find at least four satellites,
  make sure there is nothing obstructing the device's view of the sky.
  
  If you have problems with the geopoint widget, 
  be sure to note the elapsed time
  and accuracy (if applicable),
  so that you can share it with your support staff 
  or with the |forum|_.

Scaling down images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Images created with any of the image widgets described above can be automatically scaled down on save by using the ``max-pixels`` parameter. If the long edge of the image is larger than the maximum size specified, the image is resized proportionally so that the long edge matches the provided pixel value. This is useful to reduce the upload size when bandwidth is limited. 

Available in Collect since v1.10.0 and in XLSForm since 7/2018.

.. rubric:: XLSForm

In the parameters column, write ``max-pixels=`` followed by the desired maximum length of the long edge in pixels.

.. _hidden-questions:

Hidden questions

which are accessible as :ref:`variables <variables>`
and available in Aggregate and other data analysis tools.

.. contents::
  :local:
  
.. _metadata:

Metadata 
~~~~~~~~~~

Metadata questions capture information about 
the device or the survey collection event
and are not visible to the user. 
A more complete record of user behavior within a form 
can be generated by enabling :doc:`form audit logging <form-audit-log>`.


These items are dependent on the survey collection event:

- :tc:`start` --- The time the survey was started.
- :tc:`end` --- The last time the survey was saved.
- :tc:`today` --- The current date, according to the device, when the survey is collected.

These items are defined by the device and cannot be changed:

- :tc:`deviceid`
- :tc:`subscriberid`
- :tc:`simserial`

These items are defined in Collect, 
and :ref:`can be edited in Settings <form-metadata-settings>`:

.. _field-list:

Grouping multiple widgets on the same screen
------------------------------------------------

type
  :tc:`begin_group`
appearance
  :tc:`field-list`

The :tc:`field-list` appearance attribute, applied to a group of widgets, displays them all on a single screen.

.. warning::

  Do not include a question that depends on a previous answer
  in the same field list as the previous question it depends on.
  
  Relevance and calculation values are determined
  when the screen advances,
  which does not happen between questions
  that are grouped on the same page.
  Therefore,
  including a question and its dependent together in a field list
  will not work as expected.

.. seealso::

  :ref:`groups` and :ref:`repeats`.

Select widgets included in a :tc:`field-list` group can have one of several :th:`appearance` attributes:

:tc:`label`
  Only the option labels are displayed, without checkboxes.
:tc:`list`
  The labels are displayed along with
  checkboxes for multi-select questions
  and
  radio buttons for single-select questions.
:tc:`list-nolabel`
  Only checkboxes or radio buttons are displayed,
  without their labels.
  This is often used for sets of questions with repeated answer choices.
