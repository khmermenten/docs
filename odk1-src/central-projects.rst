Managing Projects in Central
============================

New as of `version 0.4 <https://github.com/opendatakit/central/releases/tag/v0.4.0-beta.1>`_, almost everything in ODK Central is organized by Project. Forms, Managers, and App Users are all partitioned by project. Both on the administration website as well as on a mobile device (within ODK Collect, for example), access to each project and its forms can be managed person-by-person. Only the Central administrative staff can create and grant initial access to projects.

.. _central-projects-overview:

Projects Overview and Roadmap
-----------------------------

Projects are a work in progress that we will add to and improve over the next few releases. As of **version 0.4**, projects work like this:

 - All **forms** must belong to a project. It is not possible to create a form that is not part of a project. It is not possible to assign one form to multiple projects (though the same form may be uploaded to as many projects as desired).
 - All **App Users** (who may access Central forms through mobile device applications like Collect) must also belong to a particular project.
    - When a user connects to a project through Collect, they will only be able to see and submit new data to forms within that project.

In the next release, **version 0.5**, we plan to add the following:

 - No longer will all **Web Users** (who are allowed to administer ODK Central through the management website) have administrative access to the main settings and all projects.
 - Rather, only users marked **administrator** will have this access.
 - Normal Web Users who are not Administrators can be made Managers on select projects. These users have the ability to manage anything about the project. They can:
    - Appoint other project managers.
    - Create, manage, and archive forms on the project.
    - Access all submitted data within the project.
    - Create, manage, and retire App Users for the project.
    - Manage and archive the project itself.

And in future releases beyond that, we have a `loose roadmap <https://github.com/opendatakit/central/issues/35>`_ with at least the following goals:

 - Change the relationship between Collect and Central so that with one button you can synchronize the mobile device to some centrally managed desired state.
    - So for instance, you can decide which forms should be available on Collect within Central once, and within Collect just press "synchronize" to update to that state.
    - Eventually, Collect app settings may be synchronized this way as well.
    - And eventually, different App Users of different roles may be assigned different device states.
 - Better, centralized form workflow/status management.
 - More granular project access: for example, a project Web User role type that grants read-only access to submitted data.
 - Download an entire projectâ€™s data at once.

If you have ideas on how projects might be made more useful for you, please do not hesitate to leave us feedback on the `ODK Forum <https://forum.opendatakit.org/c/features>`_.

.. _central-projects-migrate:

Migrating to Projects
---------------------

If you have an ODK Central server installed which is version 0.3 or earlier, your existing data will be migrated into a project when you update.

All of your existing forms and App Users will be placed into a project entitled "Forms you created before projects existed". There are no longer site-wide App Users, so that panel will no longer be present.

.. admonition:: Important: Preparing for version 0.5

  Mobile clients like Collect which were configured to access version 0.3 will continue to work without intervention for version 0.4, but they must be reconfigured with a new QR Code access token from Central when possible, because for version 0.5 this backwards compatibility will be removed.

.. _central-projects-create:

Creating a Project
------------------

Only ODK Central administrators may create projects. To create a project, navigate to the Projects section of the Central management homepage, and click on the :guilabel:`New` button.

   .. image:: /img/central-projects/new.png

You will be asked for a name for your new project. When you provide one and press :guilabel:`Create`, your project will be created and you will be taken to its management page.

.. _central-projects-manage:

Managing a Project
------------------

You can find all the projects you have access to in the Projects section of the ODK Central management website homepage.

   .. image:: /img/central-projects/list.png

When you click on its name, you will be taken to its management page.

   .. image:: /img/central-projects/overview.png

Here, you will find some basic details about the project, and a listing of all the forms in the project. You can click on any form name to :ref:`manage that form <central-forms-overview>` and view its submission data.

From the navigation tabs below the project name, you can also navigate to the App Users management page for that project, from which you can :ref:`create, manage, and retire app users <central-users-app-overview>`.
